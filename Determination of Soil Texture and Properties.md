##### Determination of Soil Texture and Properties

We will be leveraging the OpenLandMap datasets to analyze and describe the clay, sand, and organic carbon content of soil. 
To provide a comprehensive understanding of soil water content, we utilize a global dataset of soil water content at field capacity, generously provided by Hengl & Gupta (2019), with a remarkable resolution of 250 meters.

However, we noticed a gap in the available data regarding the water content of soil at the wilting point. 
To address this, we have developed a methodology that incorporates the aforementioned equations and utilizes the global datasets to determine both the field capacity and wilting point parameters.
By considering the sand, clay, and organic matter contents of the soil, we can accurately estimate the water content at these critical points.

It's worth mentioning that the datasets we utilize are based on machine learning predictions derived from a comprehensive compilation of soil profiles and samples from around the world. 
This ensures that our analysis is based on robust and reliable data.

To provide transparency and reproducibility, we have documented the detailed processing steps involved in our analysis. 
You can find a comprehensive description of these steps here.

The information we provide, including clay and sand content, is available at six standard depths: 0cm, 10cm, 30cm, 60cm, 100cm, and 200cm. 
With a resolution of 250 meters, our dataset offers a detailed and comprehensive view of soil properties at these depths.
We invite you to explore our repository and leverage our findings to gain insights into soil texture and properties. 

Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or collaborate to further enhance our understanding of soil science.
